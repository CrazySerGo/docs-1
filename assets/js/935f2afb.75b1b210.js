It\'s a blockchain based on a global timeline of events with an optimized pBFT replicated state machine that can do sub-second finality times. It runs on a globally distributed \\"clock\\" with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, built to address the needs of our Multiverse.","sidebar":"docs"},"backbone/layer1":{"id":"backbone/layer1","title":"Layer 1","description":"A L1 chain (or side-chain) is a business-specific application that runs in the Multiverse (i.e., a world or a Metaverse). They are smaller, independent chains that manage their own consensus and have control over how blocks are generated. L0 does not verify or execute L1 transactions, and it only notarizes valid L1 blocks through the timeline. L1 chains are independent, interoperable application systems that benefit from Global Services. Inter-L1 communication is achieved using messages routed through L0.","sidebar":"docs"},"backbone/overview":{"id":"backbone/overview","title":"Overview","description":"The backbone of Mundis is a blockchain infrastructure. It governs all transactions that happen in the Multiverse and all its Metaverses, handles consensus between validators, and keeps a verified history of all Layer 1 worlds. The Backbone is a development platform that will evolve to be an ecosystem of interconnected worlds.","sidebar":"docs"},"backbone/security":{"id":"backbone/security","title":"Security","description":"Mundis is a bridging protocol where each L1 chain is sovereign and must maintain its own validator set and economic security. Since L1 chains are sovereign, the L0 chain is protected from L1 chain attacks.","sidebar":"docs"},"backbone/services":{"id":"backbone/services","title":"Global Services","description":"Some critical services are needed for a Metaverse to work. These services are hereafter named L0 services. L0 services are deployed by L0 and run inside Architect nodes. They are native L0 system programs that can be consumed by L1 chains or external actors. Consuming an L0 service might incur fees, depending on the nature of the action. Actions that alter the state of the ledger will have transaction fees because they require transaction validation.","sidebar":"docs"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Welcome to Mundis","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"docs"},"metaverse":{"id":"metaverse","title":"The Metaverse","description":"Think of it as a virtual world. It can be a computer-generated world or an augmented reality environment. It is a place anyone can visit and interact with using a computer, smartphone, or specialized VR/AR device. However, most importantly, there won\'t be a single Metaverse. Instead, as with any new concept, many companies will push their version of the Metaverse with specific benefits, features, economics, graphics, collectibles, and assets. As a result, we will have many Metaverses to choose from: gaming worlds, infinite maps, workplaces, social environments, and much more.","sidebar":"docs"},"multiverse/access":{"id":"multiverse/access","title":"Access","description":"Gaining access to the Mundis boulevard or its side streets is a two-step process.

Some Global services are restricted only to Citizens (i.e., LaunchPad, Location, Marketplace), but an L1 chain can also make its services available only to Citizens if the builder of the L1 chain chooses to do so."},"multiverse/gaming":{"id":"multiverse/gaming","title":"Gaming","description":"Gaming is an integral part of the Mundis experience, and all interaction with the platform will be gamified to an extent. On-platform gamification will reward the evolution of your avatar, the types of interaction users get involved in, and the feedback you get from other users. A brand experience can also be gamified, allowing parallel quests, the gathering of experience, or other reward systems to motivate users.","sidebar":"docs"},"multiverse/layer2":{"id":"multiverse/layer2","title":"Layer 2","description":"The Construct","sidebar":"docs"},"multiverse/nft":{"id":"multiverse/nft","title":"NFTs","description":"In Mundis, Non-fungible assets (NFTs) have some important distinctions to fungible assets (tokens).
