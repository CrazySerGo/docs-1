(“Terms”) apply to your access to and use of the websites,
platform and other online products and services (collectively, the “Mundis Services”) provided by
Mundis Labs SRL. (“Company” or “we”) in connection with Rattle &amp; Shake devnet and testnet (“Rattle &amp; Shake”).
By registering in the Mundis Rattle &amp; Shake campaign, or by using our Mundis Services, you agree to these Terms, including the
waiver and release set forth in Section 12. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our
Mundis Services.</p><p>If you have any questions about these Terms, the Mundis Services or Rattle &amp; Shake, please
contact us on Discord.</p><h1>1. Eligibility; KYC Requirements</h1><p>In order to use the Mundis Services and participate in Rattle &amp; Shake, you must: (i) be a natural
person who is at least 18 years of age, who is not a current employee of the Company, and who
will be providing the R&amp;S Services (as defined below) to Company, and the R&amp;S Services (x) are
not in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction and (y) do not
directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for Company’s securities; and (ii) provide
certain Know Your Customer (“KYC”) documentation to our designated KYC provider prior to
using the Mundis Services or participating in Rattle &amp; Shake. Note that residency of each
participant is established by the KYC process, and if a participant is found to be a resident of a
country outside the United States, then the participant’s participation in Rattle &amp; Shake, including
any and all R&amp;S Services (defined below) must take place outside the United States.</p><p>By registering in Rattle &amp; Shake,  you accept, you represent and warrant that you meet the requirements contained in
this Section. If you do not meet the requirements contained in this Section, you may not use the
Mundis Services or participate in Rattle &amp; Shake.</p><h1>2. Rattle &amp; Shake Details</h1><p>(a) Registration for Rattle &amp; Shake is scheduled to begin in May 2022.</p><p>(b) The objective of Rattle &amp; Shake is to identify and understand any system and operational
design flaws by incentivizing participants to stress test the network of Rattle &amp; Shake’s
underlying Protocol through various, performance focused, challenges. In addition to these
stress tests, and subject to these Terms’ prohibited conduct restrictions (described below),
the Rattle &amp; Shake participants are encouraged to design and implement adversarial strategies
toward each other in order to test the security and robustness of the network. </p><p>(c) As a Rattle &amp; Shake participant, you will be responsible for the following services:</p><ul><li>Maintaining an operating node for at least 50% of the active Rattle &amp; Shake event time, as specified by the Company;</li><li>Participation in at least one of the three Rattle &amp; Shake events (each, a “Stage”); and</li><li>Reporting any software bugs to the Company</li></ul><p> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- -->Such services, collectively, are the “<strong>R&amp;S Services</strong>”</p><p>(d) As a participant in Rattle &amp; Shake, the Company will issue you devnet and testnet tokens for use solely
during Rattle &amp; Shake in order to provide the R&amp;S Services. The devnet/testnet tokens have no
monetary value, cannot be exchanged for Mundis mainnet coins (“MUNDIS”), cash, securities or
other property, and are at all times the sole property of the Company. At the completion of
Rattle &amp; Shake (or, if earlier, when you cease to be a participant in Rattle &amp; Shake), all devnet and testnet
tokens will be automatically returned to the Company. At all times during Rattle &amp; Shake
and thereafter, you have no rights, title or ownership interests in or to the devnet/testnet tokens or
to any number of MUNDIS related to the number of devnet and testnet tokens the Company provided to you
as part of Rattle &amp; Shake. You expressly represent and warrant that you have no expectation
of ownership of or profit from the devnet or testnet tokens.</p><p>(e) The Company reserves the right to immediately terminate the participation of any participant
who engages in prohibited conduct (as described below) or if the participant fails to provide
the minimum level of R&amp;S Services described above. </p><p>(f) At the conclusion of Rattle &amp; Shake, the Company will review the performance of each
participant. Based on the absolute and relative performance rendered by each participant
who competed Rattle &amp; Shake in good standing and without engaging in prohibited conduct
(as described below) (any such participants, the “Finalists”) the Company will determine
whether and how many MUNDIS to award to each Finalist in its sole and absolute discretion as a
reward for completing Rattle &amp; Shake and being a Finalist (each, a “MUNDIS Reward”). However,
in no event will any participant receive more than 150,000 MUNDIS in any given stage of Rattle &amp; Shake,
so that the maximum MUNDIS Reward for a participant who completes all stages will
not be greater than 150,000 MUNDIS. The Company will review performance and make
determinations not later than 45 days after Rattle &amp; Shake has ended and intends to issue
any MUNDIS Rewards after the Mundis mainnet is launched.</p><p>(g) MUNDIS will be offered as MUNDIS Rewards; however, the Company makes no promises that each
Finalist will receive any minimum or maximum number of MUNDIS as a MUNDIS Reward. The Company
has no obligation to distribute or award all of these MUNDIS at the conclusion of Rattle &amp; Shake.
No participant has a legally binding right to receive any MUNDIS as a result of their participation
in Rattle &amp; Shake. The Company will be relieved of any and all obligations to issue MUNDIS
Rewards if the Company, in consultation with legal counsel, determines that such issuances
cannot be completed at a commercially reasonable cost without violating applicable laws.</p><p>(h) Any assets that the Company may set aside to help cover any liabilities with respect to this
Rattle &amp; Shake, including any MUNDIS Rewards, are and will remain general assets of the Company
and subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors. </p><p>(i) To receive any MUNDIS Reward, a Finalist must sign the Company’s standard form of MUNDIS Reward
Agreement which will include the terms and conditions governing the ownership and use of
the MUNDIS that are issued as the MUNDIS Reward, including but not limited to applicable lockups
required by securities laws, blackout dates and tax reporting information. </p><p>(j) Participation in Rattle &amp; Shake does not create an employment relationship between the
participant and the Company or any of its affiliates. Nothing contained in these Terms will be
construed to create between the Company or its affiliates and any participant any
employment relationship or right to provide services following the conclusion of Rattle &amp; Shake.
You understand and agree that you are an independent contractor to the Company and
are not authorized to act as, or represent oneself as, an officer, employee or agent of the
Company for any purpose. No participant has any authority to enter into any agreements or
incur any obligations on behalf of the Company. No participant will be eligible for
participation in the Company’s employee benefit programs, unemployment benefits, or
compensatory arrangements for service providers by virtue of their participation in Rattle &amp; Shake.
Each participant is solely responsible for all foreign, federal, state and local taxes,
interest and penalties associated with the participant’s eligibility to receive, receipt of and
disposition of MUNDISs in connection with Rattle &amp; Shake.</p><p>(k) With respect to each participant, the Company will not withhold any amounts for payment
of any federal, state, or local taxes unless applicable law requires us to do so. You expressly
acknowledge and agree that you have the sole responsibility to pay all taxes, if any, and file
all tax returns required by applicable laws, in respect of any amounts provided by the
Company or its affiliates to you due to participation in Rattle &amp; Shake. </p><h1>3. Penetration and Vulnerability Testing</h1><p>You are solely responsible for checking with your cloud service, data-center or other applicable

MUNDIS Rewards being voided or other actions, as determined solely by the Company in its
discretion. Further, enforcement of this Section is solely at Company’s discretion, and failure
to enforce this section in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce
