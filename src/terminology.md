The following terms are used throughout the documentation.

## L0
The role of L0 is to coordinate the Multiverse and all associated Metaverses. It's a blockchain based on a global timeline of events with an optimized pBFT replicated state machine that can do sub-second finality times. It runs on a globally distributed "clock" with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, built to address the needs of our Multiverse.

## L0 account
A record in the L0 ledger that either holds data or is a system program.

## VDF
A function that takes a fixed amount of time to execute that produces a proof that it ran, which can then be verified in less time than it took to produce.
