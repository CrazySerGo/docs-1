## Introduction

Mundis is an open-source implementation of a Multiverse ecosystem. It's a set of building blocks required to achieve a scalable, interoperable Multiverse ecosystem (Metaverses, NFTs, GameFi) where users socialize, work, navigate, shop, and create experiences.
The objective of Mundis is to deliver technology, standards, and protocols for current and future Metaverse projects. It's an layered architecture, where each layer performs a specific function: 

* **Layer 0**: the backbone of Mundis is a [Solana](https://docs.solana.com/introduction)-based blockchain with sub-second finality times, inter-chain data exchange, distributed storage, identity management, naming system, and required supporting services for Metaverse projects
* **Layer 1**: byzantine state-machines with custom consensus rules, assets, and governance built using the [Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/getting-started/overview/) framework
* **Layer 2**: an extensible UI infrastructure where developers deploy their visual assets, experiences and Metaverses

Developers use Mundis to build their Metaverse projects as Layer 1 byzantine state-machines, define their economic rules and interactions, issue their tokens, NFTs and assets. Metaverse projects that build on Mundis are natively interoperable and deeply integrated in the ecosystem. Tokens and NFTs can be used across the entire Multiverse, teleported to/from other blockchains, and integrated natively in the UI.

Mundis is both a technology and visual platform, delivering a complete operating system for Metaverse projects to thrive. It provides all required tools and services for technical and economic exchange, payments, DeFi, visual asset and game development. It's a complete ecosystem where Validators participate in Layer 0 and Layer 1 consensus to validate transactions and secure the Multiverse.

## Why Mundis ?

We believe the Metaverse's vast benefits are untapped yet. We believe it can become a mainstream medium of engagement, servicing all user categories through useful tools and thrilling experiences. And we believe this will be achieved well before VR/AR technology becomes affordable and advanced enough for the mainstream market. 

Using standard 3D desktop and mobile environments, we propose a multiverse ecosystem of parallel, interconnected worlds, designed for massive scale, extreme performance, and unlimited extensibility. An ecosystem where builders and citizens are equipped with all necessary tools and means to build on and immerse in a variety of Metaverses, using their desktop or mobile phones.
This ecosystem is hereafter named Mundis. Since we are building a multiverse, Mundis is not only a blockchain, but a layered architecture of interoperable worlds, services, and human interaction devices.

Each layer provides specific services to a Metaverse, from critical infrastructure to end-user interaction. The layers presented below are what we identified to be the starting point of our Multiverse. As the system evolves, new layers might be added to accommodate future requirements:

* **Layer 0**: An infrastructure chain that provides a global, forward-moving clock, checkpoints L1 chains, handles positioning and global navigation, and drives governance for the Multiverse. It has a fast consensus mechanism designed for speed and sub-second finality, and native support for Multiverse services: Identity Management, Name Service, Decentralized Storage, CDN, Launchpad, Bridges, Garbage Collection, Location, etc.
* **Layer 1**: Interoperable worlds, created as specialized, byzantine state machines with PoS-based consensus. Each chain has its own genesis and consensus rules, optional smart-contract support, DAOs, and more.
* **Layer 2**: The Human-Computer Interface (HCI) to interact with the Multiverse using desktop, mobile and AR/VR devices. It's an engaging visual, interactive experience for users to immerse themselves in the Multiverse.
