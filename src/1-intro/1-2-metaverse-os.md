title: 1.2 The Metaverse OS

An Ecosystem environment designed to grow metaverses

**Metaverse needs:**

**Any decentralized metaverse needs a secure, fast, and scalable blockchain structure and services**

- Layer 0 backbone with sub-second finality times, inter-chain data exchange, distributed storage, identity management, a naming system, and required supporting services for Metaverse projects.
- Layer 1 byzantine state machines with custom consensus rules, assets, and governance
- App Layer with an extensible UI infrastructure where Metaverse projects deploy their visual assets, experiences, and Metaverses.

**It needs a lot of user exposure**

The Construct, our Metaverse Hub works as a visual and economic interface for connecting multiple Metaverses and Parachains and helping them act as a single ecosystem. The purpose of the Hub is to create an audience base for all the Mundis metaverses and Parachains. Interaction between the audience and the metaverses will be sustained by the Construct engage-to-earn systems.

**And it needs to grow**

This is why we're making it easy for business developers to create or tap into economies, deploy and connect Metaverses and parachains, and market their brands and products using Construct systems.
