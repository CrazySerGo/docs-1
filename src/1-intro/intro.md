This is a one-pager high-level explainer of Mundis. It's an abstract aimed to get a quick understanding of the project before diving further into this Whitepaper.
This paper describes the building blocks required to achieve a scalable, interoperable Multiverse ecosystem (Metaverses, NFTs, MetaFi) where users socialize, work, navigate, shop, and create experiences. The objective of Mundis is to deliver technology, standards, and protocols for current and future Metaverse projects:

- Layer 0 backbone with sub-second finality times, inter-chain data exchange, distributed storage, identity management, a naming system, required supporting services for Metaverse projects, and the MetaFi
- Layer 1 - byzantine state machines with custom consensus rules, assets, and governance
- App Layer - with an extensible UI infrastructure where Metaverse projects deploy their visual assets, experiences, and Metaverses.

Developers use Mundis to build their Metaverse projects as Layer 1 machines, define their economic rules and interactions, and issue their tokens, NFTs, and assets. Metaverse projects that build on Mundis are natively interoperable and deeply integrated into the ecosystem. Tokens and NFTs can be used across the entire Multiverse, bridged to and from other blockchains, and integrated natively into the UI.

Mundis is both a technology, experience, and media platform, delivering a complete operating system for Metaverse projects to thrive. It provides all required tools and services for technical and economic exchange, payments, DeFi, visual assets, and game development.
