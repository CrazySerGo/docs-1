title: 1.1 The Metaverse Blockchain
---
Any Metaverse has some specific requirements, given its multi-world nature and complexity of interactions between its worlds and users. Until now, the concept of parallel task processing has been adopted to increase efficiency. Sharding is the first attempt at parallel processing. However, it is only a primitive approach with many challenges like inter-shard transaction processing, fast consensus between validators, cross-shard smart contracts, and more.

To achieve a parallel, multi-world distributed architecture, a different approach is needed, and that approach is based on a parallel, interoperable, distributed multi-chain architecture. Notable projects like Cosmos and Polkadot are leading the multi-chain battle. Cosmos uses the Tendermint consensus, which is a protocol that provides instant finality, producing and finalizing one block at a time. However, because it's a classic pBFT algorithm, it has ùëÇ(ùëõ2) transport complexity and can only finalize one block at a time [1]. Polkadot's Relay Chain will have a maximum of 100 slots for Parachains. Out of 100, a few are reserved for Parathreads and other dedicated Bridges (Bitcoin), leaving even less for users. This is obviously not enough. The Metaverse is ultimately an ecosystem of infinite systems that must exchange information reliably and perform interactions in a non-repudiable way.
