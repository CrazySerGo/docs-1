title: 3.2 Engage-to-earn systems
---
The Construct Engage-to-Earn ecosystem unifies several GameFi, SocialFi, and WorkFi separate systems, where the incentive for the user to engage with gameplay, or a social event, is supplied by a Sponsor, either fully - or in a partnership with Mundis, in exchange for brand exposure or marketing.

How does it work:

**Citizens** interact with construct gameplays, social network, or collaboration tools. In turn, they get rewarded with power-ups, experience points, and various tokens, and are exposed to contextual branded content.

The Engage to Earn system allows Brands to market and advertise their product or initiative in an organic, contextual manner, by fueling specific essential parts of each MetaFi system, gratifying involvement in exchange for brand exposure or sales motivation.

The rewards earned by users increase proportionally with sponsorships. The greater the sponsored amounts, the better a Brand can use the content targeting algorithm of the social network.

  - Rooftop Gameplays
  - Drop Zones
  - Guided Experiences

## 3.2.1 Citizens

Mundis users become Citizens by getting a Multiverse identity. A Citizen can have an active role in Mundis or other metaverses. Each user will develop a unique own presence inside the Mundis Construct, based on taste, activity, interests, or choices.

Citizenship is based on Wallet identity. Each Citizen's identity receives the same stats values, which will increase based on the Citizen's activity and achievements.

### 3.2.1.1 Citizen stats

**Knowhow** – reflecting his interaction with the construct and all the metaverses or parachains.

Knowhow progress points will be awarded for completing daily participation tasks. For each knowhow level, an increasing number of progress points will be necessary.

The higher the knowhow value – the cheaper will be to upgrade all your avatars to a higher level.

**Responsibility** – reflecting the level of participation in the construct administration

Responsibility progress points will be awarded for completing daily platform responsibility tasks. For each responsibility level, an increasing number of progress points will be necessary.

The higher the responsibility value – the cheaper will be to upgrade all your avatars to a higher level.

**Drama** – reflects the development of the citizen's social and communication abilities

Drama progress points will be awarded for completing daily platform social development tasks. For each drama level, an increasing number of progress points will be necessary.

For each drama level, you will be able to add another point to an avatar's flair skill.

These stats will affect how the user interacts with Construct systems, laws & environment.

### 3.2.1.2 Citizen rights

Each Citizen has the right to:

- Create a personal or business account in the Social Network, connecting all Mundis users
- Use, Manage and Upgrade his Personal Space
- Participate in any Construct systems
- Visit and use any public Mundis Metaverse or parachain
- Create, trade & store NFTs in their Wallet & Wardrobe inventory.
- Receive, personalize, and use 1 upgradable initial NFT Avatar from the Construct
- Own, trade, and use multiple NFT Avatars

## 3.2.2 Wallet & Inventory

Each Citizen's wallet will hold all his tokens and NFTs and will represent his MetaFi Inventory, syncing with the Wardrobe and Marketplace.

## 3.2.3 Wardrobe & Marketplace

NFT trading is sustained by the Marketplace & Wardrobe

The Marketplace is an external site, while The Wardrobe is a Construct integrated module used to mint or trade NFTs

The Wardrobe is also the place where you can edit your avatars and their setup.

### 3.2.3.1 NFT Creators

Circulating NFTs can have 5 sources:

- **Mundis Metaverse & parachain NFT Drops/Minting**

Any Mundis metaverse or parachain can launch its own NFT collection on the Launchpad and Marketplace, whether they participate in the Construct or not.

- **Bridged Collections from other blockchains**

NFTs that were bridged from other markets or blockchains, to be re-sold within the Mundis Marketplace.

- **Mundis & Partners Construct NFT Drops/Minting**

NFTs launched by Mundis in collaboration with partners, using the Launchpad. They can be sold in the marketplace/wardrobe, or they can be won by the users.

The size and frequency of new NFT collections will depend on the size and capacity of the Boulevard.

Each new building that enters the boulevard will add a new number of NFTs to the upcoming collections.

- **Builder Storefront Drops/Mints**

Construct NFTs launched by approved third parties, following Mundis design guidelines. They will be available in the Builder storefront.

- **Citizen Sale**

Construct NFTs made by regular Citizens and listed for sale on their inventory list.

### 3.2.3.2 NFT categories

Mundis NFTs will extend the Metaplex Protocol to support:

- creating/minting NFTs
- auctions for primary/secondary sales
- visualizing NFTs in a standard way across wallets and applications
- creating storefronts
- royalties for collaborating on creating content

The mission of Mundis is to standardize the NFT protocol to a greater extent, allowing anyone to easily upload a collection, mint, display, and monetize their creations in the Multiverse and all associated Metaverses.

The Construct will integrate these NFT categories:

- **Avatars**: New avatars can be minted from the Wardrobe, in an amount depending on citizen Know-how. Each fresh avatar will start either with a randomly placed 20 ability points, for a discount price, or focused on a particular avatar specialization, for a higher cost.
- **Skins**: Avatar physical features can be edited to match common physical features, but NFT skins can also be used on Avatars and can feature a passive effect.
- **Clothing & Accessories**: The avatar can wear clothing, shoes, and accessories. These accessories can also feature a passive effect.

  - Headwear
  - Top
  - Bottom
  - Jacket
  - Shoes
  - Small storage space like a backpack or bag
  - Hand accessories
  - Neck accessories
- **Avatar reactions**: Can be base reactions or combinations of base reactions, resulting in complex reactions.

  - Facial Expressions (the mood of your avatar)
  - Body Movements (what your avatar does)
  - Recorded text (certain props that you can edit text on)
  - Audio (pre-recorded, or recorded by the user)
  - Special effects (spectacular effects that compliment your mood: an explosion, a cloud over your head)
  - Special items
- **Regular game Items**: These are basic, unenhanced items that offer a base benefit, system, or game utility. They can be received, bought, made, or won by Citizens, as a result of their successes.
- **Special Items**: Enhanced or upgraded items
- **Buildings**: The Main interest vectors on the Boulevard, and vital parts of the Construct, buildings are Engage-to-earn building blocks. Through them, Citizens can access a Metaverse or guided experience. On their surface - they hold individual gameplay, split into rentable sections. Each section's rewards are powered up daily, by the owner or renter, and - in equal amounts – by the Construct. Each building also comes with a Boulevard public space in front of it, with several Citizen utilities that can be used to bring profit or exposure to the owner or renter.
- **Public and Personal Space Environments & addons**

  - Environments are theme packs for Public, Personal Spaces, or HQs. They contain a specific scene that can be edited which becomes the setup of the surrounding environment. They can be minted in basic form or bought from the marketplace/wardrobe.
  - Different upgradable addons to further personalize the PS experience. They can be minted or bought from other users on the Wardrobe. They will be editable in varying degrees, according to the upgrade level.
- **Membership NFT collections**: NFT holders will gain access to all gatherings and events held by the collection issuer and will earn an increased token bonus from the platform for attending them.
- **Platform recorded Content**: Moments are 10 s video snapshots automatically provided by the Construct when engaging in different MetaFi systems or recorded by the Citizens themselves. Their size can be larger, according to the Drama level of the recorder.

Items made, bought, or won will be visible on any Citizen's wallet inventory, or Marketplace or Wardrobe listings.

### 3.2.3.3 NFT Enhancers

To enhance the utility of NFTs, the Construct will offer options to integrate with different other engage-to-earn systems: user evolution system, the social networking and interaction system, work and collaboration system, game systems, and administration.

The enhancements will be launched by Mundis as a limited-tiered collection of enhancing NFTs:

**Primary ability**

- Strength – minor / medium / major
- Agility – minor / medium / major
- Stamina – minor / medium / major
- Flair – minor / medium / major

**Secondary skill**

While you use the enhanced item, a corresponding secondary skill will be upgraded according to the points added to the primary. This effect lasts only while using the item.

**Special abilities**

Like enhanced jumping, super climbing, gravity nullifier, teleport, and camo. Special abilities will also be tiered into basic, special, cool, and OG

**Effects**

Specific visual effects can be added to illustrate the enhancement and add dramatic effect. Effects can be personalized by users in the Sandbox.

**Enhancer Drops**

Different collections will target different Construct NFT collections.

Enhancing NFTs can be combined in the order below and used to amplify various Construct NFTs (if they support it). Their cost will vary according to their power and purpose:

- **Level 1.** Primary ability enhancers (minor +1, medium +2, high +3)
- **Level 2.** Secondary skill enhancers (boost time, vision scope)
- **Level 3.** Granting special abilities like enhanced jumping, super climbing, gravity nullifier, teleport, camo
- **Level 4.** Effects

Surprise enhancer packs can be bought in bundles for a discount price.

### 3.2.3.4 Auctions

The NFT marketplace will support four types of auctions derived from English auctions:

1. **Single Item**: can be used to sell Standard NFTs and re-sell Print NFTs, as well as the sale of Master NFTs themselves (and the associated printing rights) if the artist so wishes.
2. **Open Auction**: requires the offering of a Master NFT that specifically has no fixed supply. The auction will only create Print NFTs for bidders. Each bidder is guaranteed to get a unique print. (There are no "winners" in this type of auction). An open auction can:
   - have a pre-set fixed price
   - have the bid price set to the last offer
   - have no price (be free)
3. **Limited Auction**: A Master NFT may be provided to the auction with several copies that represent the number of winner places. For each winner, a Print NFT will be minted and awarded to the winning bidder of that place. For example, the first-place winner will win Print #1; the second-place winner Print #2,
4. **Tiered Auction**: a mix of the previous auction types as winning placements. For instance, the first-place winner could win a Print of Limited Edition NFT A, while the second-place winner could win a Standard NFT. In addition, participants who did not win could get a Participation Print NFT from the Master NFT.

### 3.2.3.5 Boulevard Auctions

Gaining access to the Mundis boulevard or its side streets is a two-step process:

**A.** the Citizen or Brand needs to purchase a Building NFT that can be placed on the Boulevard. This venue is an NFT and can be:

- a **Bespoke Building** created by Mundis for special partners (it includes a personalized building design, a configurable Rooftop Gameplay, and a Public Space with utilities)
- a **Standard Building** with preconfigured branding options (e.g., dedicated info spaces, logos, or other info devices) and public space.

**B.** Purchasing the Building NFT will enable the option to bid MUNDIS coin for a specific location on the Boulevard. Mundis holds auctions for all boulevard locations on a fixed schedule (trimestral, quarterly) dictated by network consensus rules.

Boulevard auctions happen on-chain, in a dedicated section of the Marketplace, so anyone that holds an NFT Building is free to submit their bid in MUNDIS coin.

Bids contain two pieces of information: the location on the Boulevard and the duration of the lease slot (max one year).

Auction winners must lock up their MUNDIS bid in a bond for the duration of the lease slot at the beginning of the auction.

Auctions use the candle mechanism to randomize the exact moment the winner of the auction is determined. Participants have a pre-set amount of time to place bids and, to ensure fair bidding, the time when the winner is determined is randomly decided on and retroactively applied to the highest bidders.

Historically, candle auctions were used in the 16th century to sell ships. At the beginning of an auction, the candle is lit and the highest bid at the time the candle runs out wins the ship. So, while there is an official end to the auction, a candle auction refers to the random spot in time that will determine the winner. This random spot is always before the official end of the auction.

## 3.2.4 SocialFi systems

The Engage to Earn SocialFi systems offer the tools and create the setup and environment for social communication, weaving an interactive framework between the Citizens. Sponsors can connect to it and use its algorithm to grow an audience and motivate it.

![](/img/img2.jpg)

#### 3.2.4.1.4 Secondary skills

Once unlocked, these skills will be modified by upgrading them and by wearing or activating special NFTs.

For each avatar level increase, an upgrade for a secondary skill is also unlocked, depending on what primary he boosts.

### 3.2.4.2 Social network and avatar interaction

Social communication and networking will be sustained by the integrated social network, and live virtual interactions (featuring all the avatar reactions) in the Construct, allowing personal communication and data exchange as well as community maintenance and growth.

The Social Networking system will have a long learning curve, guided and sustained by daily challenges, quests, or tasks that will reward with Drama points or prizes in token or NFT.

The social network will run on an algorithm promoting engagement and the production of valuable content from all Citizens.

**The system will incentivize Construct Content Creators and Influencers.**

#### 3.2.4.2.1 Network and social interaction

Citizen interaction can happen in the social network, through:

- Content
- Comments
- Content feedback
- Network Chat

Or through avatars, as:

- Reactions
- Reaction feedback
- Chat
- Audio chat

#### 3.2.4.2.2 Construct content

The Construct is a new interactive medium enabling users to enjoy and creators and brands to produce or crowdsource entertainment and virtual content.

The content created by the Citizens or Brands inside the Construct will be incentivized by the platform, and Brands will be motivated to sponsor it through the social systems.

The basic main element of this new media system is The Moment, the recording of a Construct scene centered around the avatar’s perspective.

Special attention will be given to Content Creators, allowing them to edit & personalize Moments and all Construct content to the maximum degree possible, in an accessible manner.

The content produced by Citizens, with means supplied by the Construct, and spread organically to other networks will function as advertising for the entire Mundis Ecosystem.

##### 3.2.4.2.2.1 Interactions

Are points of interaction with the system that can be shared with the online community.

All the Citizen interactions will be logged on a list. The user can review them and choose any to share with the community as a posted interaction.

Sharing of some interactions can be incentivized by Construct sponsors through the advertising system. In that case, the sharing of that interaction will be rewarded according to the reactions it receives.

##### 3.2.4.2.2.2 Moments

Moments are 10 s snapshots automatically provided by the Construct when engaging in different MetaFi systems or recorded by the Citizens themselves. Their size can be larger, according to the Drama level of the recorder.

They will be attached to visually spectacular logged interactions, and the citizens can edit them and share them with the community.

Sharing of Moments can be incentivized by Construct Citizens or Sponsors through the advertising system. In that case, the sharing of that moment will be rewarded according to the reactions it receives.

##### 3.2.4.2.2.3 Content feedback

Citizens can offer feedback on the content that reaches them, potentially improving the rewards won by the creator. Feedback can be an emoticon reaction, an avatar reaction, a comment, or a Moment created specifically to address it.

##### 3.2.4.2.2.4 Moment Reloading

A Moment can be reloaded and enhanced by other Citizens, using an editing tool. This counts as a reaction and redistributes the Moment on those citizens' posted interactions, reaching the feeds of their friends and connections.

##### 3.2.4.2.2.5 Emoticons

Emoticons can be shared on the social network:

- Support
- Dismissal
- Other complex feelings

The avatar will have several slots for quick reactions. The nr of slots increases with the citizen's drama value.

- Starting slots: 1
- Max slots: 9

#### 3.2.4.2.3 Content value algorithm

The content value will be assessed according to the feedback it receives from the community. If it received a lot of positive feedback, it could reach more citizens through their information feeds, allowing them to express their own opinion.

General Feedback to the content received will be incentivized through daily challenges.

Sponsored Feedback packages can be acquired by brands or influencers, rewarding the citizens with extra drama points. Sponsored feedback content will be tagged with a special disclaimer.

Interaction share pools can be set up by Sponsors to boost shares and reward the best performing interactions.

The Personal Space will accommodate several live guest users and will facilitate direct navigation to any public metaverses or parachains, entry to other friendly PS, or exit to the Construct Boulevard.

The Personal Space will also serve as a user Sandbox, allowing program test and integration

#### 3.2.4.3.1 Revenue

For each personal space visitor that stays for the duration of the 1-time slot during a 24h period, he & the Personal Space owner will receive a token reward.

The number of visitors that can enter a PS at the same time is limited by the PS upgrade level. 1-time slot is 10 min. More time slots are added with upgrades.

One free entry/exit door to a specific free door slot on the Boulevard can be made available for any PS guests. Extra doors can be added, upon upgrading, but at an extra cost, even if the boulevard door slot is unoccupied. For each upgrade level, an extra door can be placed inside the PS.

##### 3.2.4.3.3.1 Environments

Environments are theme packs for your PS. They contain a specific scene that can be edited that becomes the setup of your Personal Space.

They can be minted in basic form or bought from other users.

Each environment comes with a limited number of add-ons and offers a limited degree of personalization. By upgrading the environment, users receive some free add-ons, the right to mint more, and can further edit the elements in the environment.

**4. NFT Memberships**

To incentivize creators and influencers, by upgrading their PS, they will be able to unlock a series of unique Group Membership NFT collections, dedicated to the members of their social network community. The NFTs can only be minted by their community, according to an engagement hierarchy.

The minting cost of this collection will be supported by the Creator, to ensure increased fan presence at his events

NFT holders will gain access to all gatherings and events held by the creator and will earn an increased token bonus from the platform for attending them.

NFT holders will also have to right to purchase the event recording and resell it, the Creator earning royalties from the sale.

#### 3.2.4.3.5 Accessing the Boulevard

Citizens will be able to access the Boulevard through a door from their PS. To do that, they will have to place a door on a boulevard door slot. If the slot is empty, placing the door is free. If it is occupied by another citizen, you can make them a token offer for freeing the slot.

A slot on the Boulevard can be occupied for 24h. After this period, the Personal Space door will be automatically removed.

Until then, the Citizen or anyone present in the Personal Space can exit at will at that specific point on the boulevard.

**1. Door skins**

Your door can be made public and can have a personalized appearance. These door skins can feature messages, videos, or effects.

**2. Non-stop slots**

If no slot is available, the Non-Stop Personal Space slot spaces at the end of any side street.

Any number of PS can dock here with no time limit. As the side street grows and features more stores, the Non-Stop area will be pushed away to make room. These Non-Stop areas will provide ample space for communities to grow and develop; the size of these areas will also influence the value of the side-street spaces.

**3. Teleportation**

You can bypass some Construct rules and reach Boulevard hot zones by traveling through a friend's Personal Space if they secured a door slot.

It’s a Construct perk for close friends, and a reminder you need to stay close to your friends and visit them often.

#### 3.2.4.3.6 Friendly PS tour

A special mode will offer access to a non-live version of each Personal Space, that can be navigated and experienced by other users. Visiting citizens can experience media or original setups, either directly by entering the space or viewing a Space Tunnel, an exploratory experience linking many personal spaces into a walkable tunnel.

Access to your non-live PS can be made public or restricted to friends.

#### 3.2.4.3.6 The Sandbox

The Personal Space will function as a personal sandbox for any citizen. A place where they can edit different setups and functions, integrate and test special structures, guided experiences, customizable interactions, or tools, either from Mundis or their own sources.

It is a private parallel version of your personal space that allows you to create guided experiences, interactive setups, presentations, or complex Moments that can be used, shared with your guests, or sold as NFTs.

- **Speech bubble**s: the avatar will display speech bubbles to add to an ongoing voice/video conversation.
- **Mood indicator**: a voluntary setup that you share if you are bored, happy, sad, horny, or whatever you want, and it will hover by your avatar name above your head.
- **Avatar emotion effects**: ranging through all emoticons and focusing on the most used. The users/avatars should be able to use emoticons in a variety of ways, from embodying an emoticon (displaying a smiling emoticon instead of your avatar head) to handing out a little card containing an emoticon (and other cool Emoji reveals that can add style to your feedback)
- **3D text as statements**: avatars will display text either by holding it or having it hover above their head.
- **On-scene avatar entry and exit effects**: avatars will have special entry and exit effects, going in and out of a Personal/Meeting Space. From an elegant "teleportation" effect to less conventional "Kramer" entries, users will be able to extend their personality through various styles of effects.
- **Evolving elements**: Intended as presentation props, evolving elements can be displayed near the presenter to create a more evocative mood: an erupting volcano, a growing tree, a burning bridge, aging, a depleting glass, a fast-revolving sun in the sky.
- **Bots**: Bots under various forms can join your presentation, supporting your presentation flow. They can be set up before the presentation or summoned in the presentation ad-hoc. Their actions can be programmed to follow specific markers with various actions, and their movement patterns will be automated by an AI. Specific bots with special programming can also be summoned.
  **- Customizable interactions**: program the guest interaction results for different scene elements, objects, or environment detail.

### 3.2.4.4 Boulevard

The Boulevard is the wider Construct scene, where SocialFi and GameFi systems interlock to create a virtual world where Citizens can socialize, play, and discover all the Construct partners.

#### 3.2.4.4.1 General Structure

It’s a large circular Boulevard, with buildings on each side.

The Boulevard includes a walkable area, Public Spaces with SocialFi and GameFi utilities, and a vehicle traffic area.

Its length - the circle size - is determined by the number of buildings it contains. It has elastic properties, adjusting its size regularly, after the Boulevard Auction.

Each building contains an access point to the interface of another Metaverse or Parachain.

Side Streets, similar in structure to the main Boulevard, can emerge between the outer circle Buildings, and extend indefinitely. The Boulevard and Side streets can have different rules.

The graphics of the Boulevard will attempt a highly realistic mirroring of life but will feature unique architecture and structures.

#### 3.2.4.4.2 Boulevard physics

The boulevard copies natural laws, except that on The Boulevard and Side streets - all avatars are immune to impacts.

Distances can be covered at normal walking speed, using speed enhancers or vehicles.

Speed & visibility are affected by natural phenomena like the presence and position of the sun, clouds, wind, rain, or snow.

A cycle of day-night will be kept on the Boulevard. Half of the Boulevard will be day and the other night. The day-night cycle will be measured in "ticks," which are the number of times the VDF loops, approximating a fraction of a second.

Different seasons will be represented in the Construct and established by public citizen vote each month.

#### 3.2.4.4.3 Door slots

Citizens can only enter the Boulevard through their Personal Space, by occupying a free door slot, or by making a bid to the owner of an occupied one.

Door slot groups are positioned evenly on the sidewalks, in front of the Building's Public Spaces.

A door can only stay on the Boulevard for 24h. After this period, the Personal Space door will be automatically removed. The appearance of the Door on the Boulevard can be made visible to anyone. This appearance will also use skins. These skins can feature messages, videos, or effects.

If no slot is available, side streets can also be used, or the Unlimited Slots at the end of any side street. Any number of Personal Spaces can dock here with no time limit. As the side street grows and features more stores, the Unlimited Slot area will be pushed away to make room. These areas will provide ample space for communities to grow and develop; the size of these areas will also influence the value of the side-street spaces.

Citizen door slot free usage is limited, multiple door slots can be occupied at the same time for a special fee, directing all citizens toward an event or drop.

#### 3.2.4.4.4 Roadway

The roadway can only be accessed using a vehicle. Vehicles are produced in designated launch areas, can carry more than one Citizen, and perform according to the vehicle rules.

Access from one sidewalk to another will happen instantly, avoiding traffic, from any part of the sidewalk.

#### 3.2.4.4.5 Side streets

Side streets emerge when a cluster of venues choose to create a separate environment within the Construct, allowing them to bend the natural laws of the boulevard upon a common agreement with the Construct.

All venues sold on that side street will have to adhere to the rules and pay a special fee for side street maintenance.

The Construct can also extend side streets to test new mechanics or physics.

### 3.2.4.5 Buildings & Public Places

The Main interest vectors on the Boulevard, and vital parts of the Construct, buildings are Engage-to-earn building blocks. Through them, Citizens can access a Metaverse or guided experience.

On their surface - they hold individual gameplay, split into rentable sections. Each section's rewards are powered up daily, by the owner or renter, and - in equal amounts – by the Construct.

Each building also comes with a Boulevard public space in front of it, with several Citizen utilities that can be used to bring profit or exposure to the owner or renter. The maintenance of this space is the owner's responsibility.

**Buildings**

Buildings are only active if placed on a boulevard spot, leased for a certain period to the owner of the Building NFT, and obtained by participating in a Boulevard Auction.

When placed, the building becomes accessible to citizens, the owner can use its Main Entry to direct traffic toward a Metaverse, parachain, guided experience, or HQ.

Buildings will feature a Challenge - an exploration & discovery circuit on their rooftop, and other external surfaces. Completing these challenges will award Citizens with points for ability enhancement and other resources in the form of tokens or NFTs.

Each Building will bring a GAGE Utility Token* income to its owner through gameplay private acquisitions or the Advertising System.

Each day, the prizes offered in the challenges will be refreshed and replenished automatically by the Construct using the GAGE utility token, proportional to how much the owner of the building invests in daily prizes.

**Public Places**

Each building will come with a public space at the Boulevard level. It will contain an event space, a recharge space, and a gameplay sample.

The event space can be personalized for each event, like a PS, creating visibility for the owner or a sponsor brand.

The recharge space will offer fast recharge options for avatar stamina, and faster cooldowns for special items, requiring an amount of GAGE tokens from the Citizen. Recharge can be discounted or subsidized by the building owner or sponsors. To enjoy Subsidization, the citizen may be required to have a particular interaction or to share the interaction on the social network.

The public gameplay sample promoting action on the building can also be charged with daily rewards for each Citizen. These rewards can be a sponsor's Tokens or NFTs.

To contract advertising within a building's public space, a bid must be made to its owner through the Sponsor Management Dashboard.

## 3.2.5 GameFi systems

The GameFi systems are a collection of 1st person play-to-earn dynamics, each one adapted to boost and sponsor Boulevard and Building traffic.

![](/img/img3.jpg)

### 3.2.5.1 Rooftop Challenges

_(hinting to all arcade discovery Games, from Mario to Diablo)_

**Purpose**

Made to promote & integrate Buildings and enhance avatar abilities. This game mode is a system directly linked with the development of the Construct.

**Context**

To activate a Building and its Rooftop Challenge, a space on the Boulevard must be rented by staking a bid at the periodic Boulevard Auction.  To bid, you must own a Building NFT.

These NFTs will be bought from the Marketplace and can be placed in the rented space on the Boulevard.

**Concept**

Each building, apart from a visible entry to the Metaverse/ parachain / HQ, will feature a Challenge - an exploration & discovery circuit on its rooftop, and other external surfaces. Completing these challenges will award points for ability enhancement, but also other resources in the form of tokens or NFTs.

The Building gameplay can involve a specific Metaverse's mechanics and resources, but it can also be powered up with Construct tokens.

Each Building will bring a GAGE Utility Token income to its owner through gameplay private acquisitions or the Advertising System.

The nature of the Challenge can be directly linked to the Metaverse or parachain the Venue leads into, serving as a promotional and advertising space, giving users a taste of that Venue, and incentivizing them to interact with that system.

It will be an immersive, interactive user experience that can be used by the owner of the building, but with parts that can also be rented to other contractors that wish to promote, linking it to the Multiverse Advertising System.

Each day, the prizes offered in the challenges will be refreshed and replenished automatically by the Construct using the GAGE utility token, proportional to how much the owner of the building invests in daily prizes.

By renting parts of the gameplay using the Advertising System, the owner can use sponsorships to fill his part of the daily rewards.

**Strategy**

Each rooftop challenge can have a different theme, and story development can be linked to the main story or can stand alone independently.

The main points of the rooftop challenges:

1. will test the abilities and other skills of the player to enhance avatar abilities
2. will promote and test the traction and integration of the Venue economy, offering the opportunity for these economies to complement each other.
3. will provide organic growth, integration, and the fair decentralization of the player experience.

Rooftop challenges play above the actual boulevard, not hindering traffic, and offering players a Birdseye view over the boulevard, allowing them to better see any Drop Zones.

The higher the building - the farther the view.

Buildings with complex, intricate, and fun challenges will be more expensive but will return more benefits to the owner through player participation and ad rental fees.

Each building will feature several difficulty levels, to present a slow gradual learning curve, and be approachable by all range of players, from inexperienced to highly skilled.

Each building will feature unique NFT collections, with different power levels, addressing players from all experience spectrums and rewarding them accordingly. They will be either received as a bonus for participating (and upgrading will be possible by completing parts of the challenge), or as a prize.

Rooftop challenges can be only completed once every 24h and can be attempted for free at least 3 times. More attempts can be acquired by bidding to the owner of most sections.

### 3.2.5.2 Drop zones

_(Hinting to the main crypto culture common motivator: airdrops)_

**Purpose**

Made to incentivize presence, traffic, and involvement with Construct games and other venues using a random drop zone system.

**Concept**

Regularly, bright spotlights will shine on random locations on the Boulevard, growing to a random size, shining for a random time, and offering a random award to every avatar who spends a specific random time in it.

The number of rewards offered will influence the spotlight size, covering more avatars.

**Strategy**

The value of the random award will influence the difficulty to get it. The higher the reward:

- the more spotlight time will be necessary to receive it
- stronger natural elements will manifest and hinder avatars
- the ray will be more bright and more visible from the distance, prompting more avatars

Prizes will consist of NFTs and/or tokens.

The farther an avatar is from the spotlight, the more power and agility he will need to be able to reach it. Covering that distance faster can be done by upgrading your character abilities, or using other faster means, offered by special NFTs (bikes, cars, jetpacks, huge drones, teleport packs).

**Control DROP**
Drop zones can also be ordered and coordinated by contractors, using a Drop control panel. it is particularly useful for Venues, getting people to be in a certain place on the boulevard.

Their nature will be customized to a certain degree by the contractor, and specific conditions can be imposed when buying a drop: reward value, allocation, start time, drop location on the boulevard, drop duration, wearing a particular NFT, or performing a certain action within the drop zone or in other controllable areas.

A max number of drops can be bought in bulk, for a special bulk price, while single drops have a different selling value, to boost a secondary market for resellers, as the value of a drop may rise or drop according to the traffic of the specific zone of the boulevard, or the time it is deployed (high traffic times vs low traffic times).

### 3.2.5.3 Guided Experiences

Instead of creating a metaverse, a guided virtual experience can be created that presents a single storyline for the user, that he can explore using Programmable Interactions.

It's the metaverse equivalent of an advertising spot. Guests can be incentivized with completion rewards to participate in the experience. The experience can feature a game or a challenge, conditioning the reward, or can be purely experiential.

Guided Experiences can be created in the Personal Space Sandbox, or by 3rd party developers using Mundis SDK.

### 3.2.5.4 Emoji battle

_(Hinting to all fighter games and fight lore, from street fighter to MK to anime fights)_

**Purpose**

Made to enhance and incentivize Interaction and communication between players.

**Context**

The avatars will have the possibility to react with virtual emojis on the boulevard or the social network. The range of these reactions will be very vast, extending in complexity as the avatar evolves and uses them.

**Concept**

These reactions will be NFTs, and to be used they can be attached to active quick reaction slots in the UI. They can be minted, upgraded, or combined to form more complex reactions. The higher their complexity, the more often they will have to be recharged to be used.

The Emoji Battle will feature its inflationary utility token, powering the system and opening it to independent development.

Their use will usually not prompt conditioned reactions on the Boulevard or in the Personal Space, only during the Emoji Battle: a special game mode, where the avatars are seen from the side.

This game mode can be accessed from anywhere If two players agree to it. The public can also be present.

**Strategy**

The Emoji Battle is going to be like an emoji duel. Each reaction will influence the environment or avatar. Reactions can also be combined to form Combo Reactions.

Each player will start with equal durability amounts. Reactions will affect the other player's durability to Emojis. The player who loses all his durability loses the round.

It will have 2 classic rounds and a 3rd final round to settle the score.

## 3.2.6 WorkFi systems

Working and collaborating in the Metaverse will be incentivized by the Construct and Partners, through Personal Space, HQ, or HQ Hub Engage-to-earn reward systems.

We aim to offer a series of helpful presentation tools, brand manifestation spaces, and management structures that allow modern business collaboration.

### 3.2.6.1 Personal Space Workplace

The Personal Space can be used as a virtual workplace for online meetings, relaying content, and presentations.

Social events and meetings are already incentivized through the SocialFi system, rewarding Citizens, and promoting socialization through token rewards, using PS time slots to limit overuse. The Workplace takes it even further.

The Workplace is a Construct subscription program that can be acquired by any citizen and subsidized by Sponsors and brands, under special requirements.

The Workplace grants extra PS time slots for Colleagues and provides your Personal Space with a fixed camera mode, and several tools and setups optimized for specialized collaboration scenarios: presentations, meetings, concerts, workshops, or collaborative work.

The available camera mode help participants focus their attention on the organizer by viewing the complete Workplace scene together with text, video screens, effects, participants, and their feedback.

Instant access to your Workplace will be provided via invitation links. Anyone can join a Workplace through the invitation link as a guest or as a Citizen. The primary purpose is to allow users to create an immersive communication and presentation experience by enhancing data visualization, staging, virtual object, and image manipulation and using compelling novel video and text integration mechanisms.

A set of avatar and interface customizations, object inventory, setups, and actions are available by default, but 3rd party developers can contribute their content as NFTs.

Brands or Citizens can sponsor and subsidize Workplace subscriptions, fully or partially, for a Group or Citizen, and condition the benefit by requesting a particular interaction, NFT acquisition, or social network interaction.

### 3.2.6.2 Workplace tools and add-ons

Sponsors can create personalized Workplace collaboration tools: from meeting setups to addons or specific tools. They can be dropped on the Marketplace and Wardrobe, enhanced, or offered for trial within their Buildings or HQ

- **Comparison module**: Instantly draw out temporary objects displaying animals, objects, and more from a comparison library.
- **A fun voting system**: Where users can use stars, grades, and colors to vote on multiple options and add feedback to each or vote on a single thing and show the level you want to support it
- **Collaborative Whiteboard**: A collaborative tool that enables the participants in a meeting to add text, images or to draw on a highly visible whiteboard
- **Dramatic stage manipulation**: Instantly change the setup/scenery to add a dramatic effect. Meet in a generic presentation room but switch to a forest setting when you talk about sustainability or the seaside when you want to sell a soft drink. Dim lights progressively, shrink or enlarge the scene, add weather effects, use light spots
- **Conceptual data models and Formulas**: Where you can quickly form floating formulas or data models and use shapes, text, images, or video instead of numbers, helpful in attempting to explain complicated concepts or models
- **Collaborative 3d object manipulation**: Complex 3D objects can be moved around or edited by all meeting participants
- **Unveiling**: Add various revealing effects to 3d text, images, documents, or video. Either as a typical unveiling or to suggest a Tip of the Iceberg effect, where the user starts with a small thing but reveals its true size to the audience
- **Time Management (Measuring, Censoring)**: Limit meetings or personal speech time with hovering timers, personal time bars, room shrinking effects, and chess timers.
- **Randomizing effects**: Using different randomizing systems and effects to assign teams, giveaway assignments, or designate jobs to multiple people. Systems include a fortune wheel, a rock/paper/scissors game, and a spinning bottle.

### 3.2.6.3 HQ

The Headquarters serves as an actual office for your organization in the Construct.

It is a visual space that can be personalized. It contains an adaptable display space, a programable experience tool, and a meeting space that can accommodate various setups and sceneries.

Authorized users will be able to edit this space to fit presentations or meetings, showcase the company portfolio, and set up experiences or games for any guest to take part in.

HQs can be accessed from a Citizen's Personal Space, but they can also be present on the Boulevard, in the form of a building, containing the HQ entry.

Basic needs HQ are FREE and are the perfect option for a low-cost Multiverse presence, that can then be scaled up.

### 3.2.6.4 HQ HUB

To motivate a large workforce, a HQ HUB can be created, where team members have ranks, and can be incentivized according to performance or involvement reports.

A new way to enhance daily work experience in your company, do employee training and development, motivate your team, or have some fun.

The Hub is an organizational add-on to the HQ, offering multiple setups and controls. As a result, organizations can translate valuable processes in the virtual space, like brainstorming, presentations, project follow-up, and teambuilding. It will also allow the development of a healthy and engaging organizational culture using gamification elements and progressive accumulation.

## 3.2.7 Administrative systems

The Construct has an administration system made of 4 DAOs powered by the MUNDIS Token. Members must have a stake and be proposed or validated by the Mundis Foundation.

Some administrative systems can be accessed from the Launchpad or the Marketplace, but their Construct HQ is in The Multiverse Hall.

The Hall, through its DAOs, will hold Boulevard auctions, facilitate project crowdfunding, curate projects, and maintain the advertising system, the Quality Control Program, and Multiverse Expansion program.

**DAO List:**

a) **Virtual Estate DAO** - organizing auctions, crowdfunding, and developing the game through the buildings on the boulevard.

b) **Intellectual Property DAO** - security and intellectual property vetting and auditing

c) **Advertising and Media DAO** - maintaining the advertising system and regulating other media channels

d) **Multiverse Expansion DAO** - developing and running programs and strategies to expand the Multiverse in the most profitable way, finding ways to involve the external parties that will be most favored by the Multiverse community, adding more value to the entire Multiverse.

These will be public interest-focused organizations, that offer service to the entire Multiverse. They will be vetted by the Mundis Foundation Board and their service will be compensated using MUNDIS coin.

Citizens performing administrative tasks will gather more Responsibility progress points.

Responsibility progress points will be awarded for completing daily platform responsibility tasks. For each responsibility level, an increasing number of progress points will be necessary.

The higher the responsibility value – the cheaper will be to upgrade all your avatars to a higher level.

### 3.2.7.1 Virtual Estate DAO

Will oversee organizing auctions, crowdfunding, and developing the game through the buildings on the boulevard.

It will contain a board of architects, game developers, and tokenomics experts who will develop the NFT boulevard buildings and experiences by coordinating with external metaverses or parachains, or with Mundis Community interests.

### 3.2.7.2 Intellectual Property DAO

Will oversee security and intellectual property vetting and auditing.

Any Metaverses or Parachains that wish to protect the security of users or intellectual assets can obtain a Genuine Label whitelist Marker, to either protect their intellectual property or to show users or investors that it does not infringe on other existing venues' intellectual property.

Independent contractors will perform the vetting tasks upon the acquisition of a specially minted common agreement NFT, the release of which will offer the buyer the right to show the Marker across his virtual presence. This NFT will have a lifeline and will deteriorate in time and deactivate if not recharged by another audit.

### 3.2.7.3 Advertising and Media DAO

Will maintain the advertising system and regulate other media channels.

It will consist of a game creator and a client service team and will coordinate with clients using the Sponsor Management Dashboard.

The Client Service team will keep connections with clients that have more complex plans and coordinate them with the game creator team to fulfill those plans.

### 3.2.7.4 Multiverse Expansion DAO

In charge of developing and running programs and strategies to expand the Multiverse in the most profitable way, finding ways to involve the external parties that will be most favored by the Multiverse community, and adding more value to the entire Multiverse.

It will consist of a commission-based ambassador team, tasked by the community to contact, and involve external resources in the Multiverse, as well as to maximize their impact on the Multiverse.

## 3.2.8 Launchpad & DEX

The Launchpad is the central point for exploring and investing in new projects, ideas, and auctions in the Mundis ecosystem.

### 3.2.8.1 Platform projects and Construct NFT Collections

Citizens, Brands, or Developers can pitch Construct Projects and Construct NFT Collections to the Ecosystem Administration DAO.

### 3.2.8.2 Token Projects

Projects and ideas that require community involvement or financing should register on the Launchpad to describe their idea. A project may ask for community support for L1 validator seats and/or crowdfunding in exchange for the project's tokens. Each project will define its own rules, rewards, vesting schedule, and token release terms.

Anyone can request to publish their project on the Launchpad. However, to prevent malicious behavior, projects need to be vetted by L0 validators before having access to investors.

Access to Launchpad projects will be based on a "lottery format" to ensure fair access to all investors. Users can purchase up to 5 lottery tickets before a sale. Specifically, the exact number of tickets a user is given is determined based on their Mundis account balance "over 20 days." If a user maintains a sufficient account balance for said period "leading up to the day of the lottery," then they will reportedly be awarded "a maximum of 5 tickets per eligible account.".

The Launchpad will perform a transparent, randomized selection of lottery tickets 24 hours before the sale and users need to confirm how many tickets they want to purchase. Once a user confirms the number of tickets, it commits to purchase the number of tokens corresponding to the number of winning tickets."

Each new project listed on the Launchpad will reveal the maximum number of potential lottery ticket winners. Moreover, the specific "allocation amount" associated with each "winning ticket" will be announced "ahead of time." (e.g., 10,000 potential winning tickets, each representing 500 USD worth of tokens).

### 3.2.8.2 Auctions

In addition to direct participation by a single bidding entity, Mundis enables anyone to crowdsource support for their idea using the Launchpad. In this approach, Mundis token holders can bond their tokens to signal support for a particular project in exchange for project-related benefits (e.g., airdrops, discounts, yield, etc.) If the project wins, the bonded tokens are locked by the network for the duration of the lease, after which the tokens are unlocked and may be reclaimed by those who contributed.

If the auction is not won, the bonded funds are returned to their owners.

## 3.2.9 Brands

The Mundis Ecosystem is designed to maintain a decentralized market, made of a Citizen audience, and to allow brands and companies to engage this audience using the Construct and the various possibilities it offers.

The Construct is a new interactive medium enabling users to enjoy and creators and brands to produce or crowdsource entertainment and virtual content.

Instead of the classic marketing and advertising centralized systems, the Mundis Construct offers a range of engage-to-earn systems, that marketers and advertisers can use as SPONSORS to create brand awareness, promote products, and directly involve and motivate their audience.

Each engage-to-earn system has different content marketing & advertising components, each focusing on a different business objective.

Going beyond the classic Web 2.0 methods, brands can now reward the audience directly, motivating their efforts and empowering them.

By creating new, decentralized assets, brands gain a loyal, strong, and involved audience.

### 3.2.9.3 Sponsor Management Dashboard

Sponsors will create a Business Profile within the Construct, through which they can interact with all the platform systems. Their profile will reflect their Sponsor Status KPIs in the Social Network and will give them access to the Sponsor Management Dashboard.

The SMD is a separate Web 3.0 site designed for Sponsors and Brands to manage their Construct marketing and advertising operations and will feature Building Management, Drop Management, door slots, or other sponsorship tools.

### 3.2.9.4 MetaFi Marketing

Companies can use standardized blockchain technology and financial tools to power up their custom decentralized economies and apply them to their own Metaverses.

Our ecosystem is designed to seamlessly link these economies with the Construct interface, a Gateway Metaverse entertaining an involved audience that can support them.

#### 3.2.9.4.1 Tokens

Are tailored cryptocurrencies that power a specific system within a game, application, or some other tailored user benefit or experience.

Brands or companies can extend their assets and create their own currency, and allocate it to participants following their own rules, using Ecosystem tools.

Tokens can be personalized to create brand value and used to power up different Construct engagement systems.

The visibility and power of a brand are connected to the success of its fungible and nonfungible tokens.

They can easily be created and managed in the Sponsor Management Dashboard, within the Mundis Marketplace.

#### 3.2.9.4.2 Metaverses

Are custom Virtual Worlds you can build and connect with the Mundis Ecosystem. They can be built using our software development toolkit, and benefit from seamless connectivity with the Construct.

These worlds can be applications, games, open spaces, guided experiences, or anything the Builder wants them to be.

A metaverse built on our blockchain will be directly accessible to any Citizen, from their Personal Space.

To simplify world creation, Brands can use the Construct tools (PS Sandbox) to build and customize rich worlds in a plug-and-play manner.

Metaverses are efficient marketing and advertising mediums, being able to drive and motivate gigantic communities.

#### 3.2.9.4.3 The Launchpad

Advertisers can use the Ecosystem Launchpad to test, fund, and promote their web 3.0 projects using crowdfunding and crowdsourcing to gain community support. All entries are curated by Mundis.

### 3.2.9.5 GameFi advertising

Sponsors can directly tap into the Construct play-to-earn systems and use them to advertise or involve Citizens in their economies.

#### 3.2.9.5.1 Rooftop challenges

Each building will feature a Challenge - an exploration & discovery circuit on its rooftop, and other external surfaces. Completing these challenges will award Citizens points for ability enhancement and other resources in the form of tokens or NFTs.

Each day, the prizes offered in the challenges will be refreshed and replenished automatically by the Construct using the GAGE utility token, proportional to how much the owner of the building invests in daily prizes.

Each Rooftop Challenge circuit features multiple levels, increasing in difficulty toward the top levels. Each level is split into sections. Each section challenge can be charged with different rewards, has editable interaction points, and style personalization.

Each section can be rented by the owner of the building using the Sponsor Management Dashboard.

By renting parts of the gameplay using the Sponsor Management Dashboard, the owner can use sponsorships to fill his part of the daily rewards.

Reward recharging and rental start with the lower levels. To rent a section from a higher level, the previous level rewards must be recharged.

The sponsor has complete freedom to edit the interaction points and section style personalization after recharging the section rewards.

Rent duration and bidding price for section rental are set by the owner.

#### 3.2.9.5.2 Drop zones

Regularly, bright spotlights will shine on random locations on the Boulevard, growing to a random size, shining for a random time, and offering a random award to every avatar who spends a specific random time in it.

The number of rewards offered will influence the spotlight size, covering more avatars.

Drop zones can also be contracted and coordinated by sponsors using the Sponsor Management Dashboard. Their strategic purpose is to get people to be in a certain place on the boulevard, to drop their tokens or NFTs, and to reward previously informed citizens or a particular public event audience.

Their nature will be customized to a certain degree by the sponsor (specific conditions can be imposed when buying a drop): reward value, allocation, start time, drop location on the boulevard, drop duration, wearing a particular NFT, or performing a certain action within the drop zone.

To boost a secondary market for resellers, as the value of a drop may rise or drop in time, according to the traffic of the specific zone of the boulevard it is deployed on, a limited nr of drops can be bought in bulk, for a special discount price.

The drops can be acquired from the SMD, a maximum of 6 months in advance.

All the profits from sponsored drops are returned to Citizens by increasing the frequency or adding more value to the daily random Construct drops.

#### 3.2.9.5.3 Guided Experiences

Instead of creating a metaverse or an open virtual space, a guided virtual experience can be created that presents a single storyline for the user, that he can explore using programable.

Interactions. It's the metaverse equivalent of an advertising spot. Guests can be incentivized with completion rewards to participate in the experience. The experience can feature a game or a challenge, conditioning the reward, or can be purely experiential.

Guided Experiences can be created in the PS Sandbox, or by 3rd party developers using Mundis SDK.

#### 3.2.9.5.4 Spectacular Moments

The Construct engage-to-earn systems pose challenges to Citizen avatars. When a difficult challenge is failed or successfully overcome, the avatar goes through a Spectacular Moment, a scripted 1 to 10-sec action scene, that the system records and logs as a shareable interaction for the Citizen.

Building owners can edit and personalize their Rooftop Challenges and public space Spectacular Moments using The Sandbox. Rooftop section rental also grants temporary editing rights to the sponsor, that can customize the moments involving brand content, and then boost them using Sponsored Feedback Packages or Interaction Share Boost Pools.

Sponsored Zone Drops also feature their own customizable Spectacular Moment, for the citizens that managed to reach them in time or for those who failed.

#### 3.2.9.5.5 Customizable NFT drops

Sponsors can create ecosystem basic NFT collections and sell them in the Marketplace and Wardrobe, either in direct collaboration with Mundis or by using SDK packages.

They can be:

- Avatars
- Skins
- Clothing & Accessories
- Regular game Items
- Avatar reactions
- PS Environments & addons

Basic items have only decorative or minimal performance boosts, but they can be combined with Enhancing NFTs.

Enhancing NFTs will offer options to integrate regular NFTs with different engage-to-earn systems: user evolution system, the social networking and interaction system, work and collaboration system, game systems, and administration.

The enhancements will be launched as a limited, tiered collection of NFTs, focusing on multiple systems.

The enhancers can be fused with basic NFTs, resulting in a special item. Each basic NFT can be fused with 4 enhancers, one from each category, starting with level 1. Fusing one level unlocks the next.

- **Level 1**: Primary ability enhancers (minor +1, medium + 2, high +3)
- **Level 2**: Secondary skill enhancers (boost time, vision scope)
- **Level 3**: Granting special abilities like enhanced jumping, super climbing, gravity nullifier, teleport, camo
- **Level 4**: Editable effects (EX: light trails for speed, area effects for strength.  Their shapes will be editable to allow for brand placement.

Each category may contain permanent or cooldown enhancers.

Enhancers can be bought in bundles for a discount.

### 3.2.9.6 SocialFi advertising

Social communication and networking will be sustained by the integrated social network, and live virtual interactions (featuring all the avatar reactions) in the Construct, allowing personal communication, data exchange, and community maintenance and growth.

#### 3.2.9.6.1 Analytics and Citizen segmentation

The Citizen profile only needs a wallet to exist, further information is not mandatory, but profiles can be further personalized if the Citizen wants to share gender, demographic, or other personal details to better filter his information feed.

Some of the interactions that the Citizen has with the platform are recorded on the blockchain, through his wallet, and are transparent: Token, NFT transactions, and public interactions. Other construct interactions can also be recorded, at the Citizen's request

The Construct algorithm will have Personas that pre-group citizens with common interactions, as their activity evolves. These pre-made groups will not hold individual data about the citizens, just their common interactions.

These interactions will form the base data pool for customer segmentation, marketing, and social analytics.

On the SMD, sponsors can target specific interaction groups, from larger, more common interactions to smaller more specific groups. Access to more specific groups will be proportional to the sponsorship value: a small incentive will grant access to wide, general groups, while a hefty incentive will allow Sponsors to better target their content.

The same algorithm will be valid for the analytics and insights sponsors can study about how the audience interacted with their initiatives: more sponsorships, more info.

#### 3.2.9.6.2 Content marketing

Business Accounts on the Social Network can build a following audience using Groups, can post content on their own content feed, and can promote this content to reach into other Citizens' feeds using the network algorithm, sponsored feedback packages, or interaction share pools.

To achieve organic reach, their content must prove valuable and draw positive feedback.

Brand content ranges from text posts and photos to Interactions or Moments.

#### 3.2.9.6.3 Events

Sponsors can organize public events in their own PS, HQ, Building, or a rented space.

All Events (Citizen and Business profiles) are incentivized by the Construct, bringing a guaranteed GAGE reward for both organizers and guests.

Events can be conferences, parties, concerts, expositions, NFT Drops, organized community games, or any other theme that would be attractive to Citizens.

Various giveaways can be organized during the events, either through programmed interactions or through a Zone Drop (if the event is held in a public space).

Content or interaction sharing from a particular event can be boosted.

#### 3.2.9.6.4 Buildings

A building on the Boulevard will allow maximum audience visibility to a brand, boosting its marketing and offering multiple advertising options.

The building will contain direct access either to the owner or, by renting some of its spaces, to a 3rd party Metaverse, parachain, or guided experience.

Gaining access to the Mundis boulevard is a two-step process: purchasing an NFT building and bidding for a specific location on the Boulevard. Auction winners must lock up their bid in a bond for the duration of the lease slot at the beginning of the auction.

Higher traffic areas will require a higher bid but will potentially turn in more visitors.

Buildings can be custom or ready-made. Both types will have integrated spaces that can be personalized with your brand image, content & rewards. The rooftop gameplay will also feature editable parts that can be used to market or promote.

Having your building in a high-traffic area and maintaining its engage-to-earn systems will help you raise the exposure value, obtain more interactions, and potentially raise the value you can rent its facilities or gameplay sections, to be used by other sponsors.

#### 3.2.9.6.5 Public social space utilities

Each building will come with a public space at the Boulevard level. It will contain an event space, a recharge space, and a gameplay sample.

The event space can be personalized for each event, like a PS, creating visibility for the owner or a sponsor brand.

The recharge space will offer fast recharge options for avatar stamina, and faster cooldowns for special items, requiring an amount of GAGE tokens from the Citizen. Recharge can be discounted or subsidized by the building owner or sponsors. To enjoy Subsidization, the citizen may be required to have a particular interaction or to share the interaction on the social network.

The public gameplay sample promoting action on the building can also be charged with daily rewards for each Citizen. These rewards can be a sponsor's Tokens or NFTs.

To contract advertising within a building's public space, a bid must be made to its owner through the Sponsor Management Dashboard.

#### 3.2.9.6.6 NFT Memberships

The membership NFTs can only be minted by the sponsor's community, according to an engagement hierarchy.

The minting cost of this collection will be supported by the Sponsor, to ensure increased fan presence at his events

NFT holders will gain access to all gatherings and events held by the Sponsor and will earn an increased token bonus from the platform for attending them.

NFT holders will also have to right to purchase the event recording and resell it, the Sponsor earning royalties from the sale.

#### 3.2.9.6.7 Boulevard Exits door slots

Sponsors can reserve multiple door slots on the boulevard and place entry doors directly to their event, this way drawing more citizens, from farther away on the Boulevard, increasing their audience and event revenue.

To do that, door slots must be reserved before the event, and activated sometime before the start of the event.

Any business profile can reserve any number of entry slots, but their price will rise with every extra door added. If the door is occupied, the sponsor can make a bid to the owner.

Door slots can be reserved in the Sponsor Management Dashboard.

#### 3.2.9.6.8 Sponsored Feedback packages

They can be acquired by Sponsors or influencers, rewarding the citizens with extra drama points for giving feedback on promotional content. Sponsored feedback content will be tagged with a special disclaimer.

Packs can be acquired from the Sponsor Management Dashboard, but their targeting will depend on the sponsorship value.

#### 3.2.9.6.9 Interaction Share boost pools

Sharing interactions can also be boosted by sponsoring a Share Boost Pool. The sharing of that interaction will be rewarded according to the reactions it receives.

### 3.2.9.7 WorkFi marketing

#### 3.2.9.7.1 The Workplace subscription

Social events and meetings are already incentivized through the SocialFi system, rewarding Citizens, and promoting socialization through token rewards, using PS time slots to limit overuse. The Workplace takes it even further.

The Workplace is a Construct subscription program that can be acquired by any citizen and subsidized by Sponsors and brands, under special requirements.

The Workplace grants extra PS time slots for Colleagues and provides your Personal Space with a fixed camera mode, and several tools and setups optimized for specialized collaboration scenarios: presentations, meetings, concerts, workshops, or collaborative work.

Brands or Citizens can sponsor and subsidize Workplace subscriptions, fully or partially, for a Group or Citizen, and condition the benefit by requesting a particular interaction, NFT acquisition, or social network interaction.

#### 3.2.9.7.2 Workplace collaboration tools

Sponsors can create personalized collaboration tools: from meeting setups to addons or specific tools. They can be dropped on the Marketplace and Wardrobe, enhanced, or offered for trial within their Buildings or HQ

#### 3.2.9.7.3 HQ

The Headquarters serves as an actual office for your organization in the Construct.

It is a visual space that can be personalized. It contains an adaptable display space, a programmable experience tool, and a meeting space that can accommodate various setups and scenery.

Authorized users will be able to edit this space to fit presentations or meetings, showcase the company portfolio, and set up experiences or games for any guest to take part in.

HQ's can be accessed from the Personal Space, but they can also be present on the Boulevard, in the form of a building, also containing the HQ entry.

HQ is FREE and is the perfect option for a low-cost Multiverse presence, that can be then scaled.

#### 3.2.9.7.4 HQ HUB

To motivate a large workforce, an HQ HUB can be created, where team members have ranks, and can be incentivized according to performance or involvement reports.

A new way to enhance daily work experience in your company, do employee training and development, motivate your team, or have some fun.

The Hub is an organizational add-on to the HQ, offering multiple setups and controls. As a result, organizations can translate valuable processes in the virtual space, like brainstorming, presentations, project follow-up, and teambuilding. It will also allow the development of a healthy and engaging organizational culture using gamification elements and progressive accumulation.
