title: 3.1 Objectives
---
**To provide a starting base for all Mundis partners and become a useful traffic venue for all the other metaverses and parachains, growing them and adding value to the entire ecosystem.**

Our target is to be the first blockchain platform to reach 1 billion individual users. This will hugely benefit the entire ecosystem. We intend to encourage mass adoption through ease of access, accessible UI, utility, entertainment, and powerful financial incentives. We intend to create a decentralized entertainment platform that can compete in the mainstream market and drive adoption beyond the crypto space.  

An equally important target is to catalyze mass adoption within companies or brands. This will bring value to the multiverse and its users. 

**To create an open Metaverse framework model that can be easily deployed and extended**

We provide a scalable Metaverse visual and MetaFi framework that can be deployed with minimal resources, then extended to the desired magnitude.  

**To offer Citizens an extensive range of MetaFi engage-to-earn systems that are fueled by high-quality services and entertainment.**

The platform engagement systems will be developed and scaled together with our partners and will be focused on providing useful tools, entertainment, and incentives for our Citizen audience, and powerful marketing and advertising framework for any brand.

GameFi systems will promote player freedom and stimulate gameplay with a challenging, entertaining, and competitive experience, and matching sponsor rewards. Participation solely for speculative reasons will be discouraged algorithmically, promoting passionate gaming instead of click farms.

Creative SocialFi systems will promote decentralized values, quality content, creativity, individual expression, and social participation. Social interaction and events will be incentivized, along with content creation produced from the GameFi and WorkFi systems. The social network will provide sponsors with analytics and a citizen segmentation system to improve content targeting.

Practical WorkFi systems will incentivize and promote Metaverse collaboration as an alternative to current WEB 2 solutions, allowing companies to create micro-economic decentralized collaboration systems.

**To drive practical purpose for the multiverse through a simple, fun, entertaining UI & UX.**

**To ensure the transparency of the decentralized system, the security of assets, human rights, and intellectual property like trademarks or copyright.**
