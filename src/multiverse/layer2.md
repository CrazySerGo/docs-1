## The Construct

Visitors and participants use a Human-Computer Interface (HCI) component to visualize and perform actions in the Multiverse. Mundis has several HCI components: 

1. A desktop interface that provides the most complete and immersive experience
2. A mobile interface for working with Mundis using your smartphone
3. AR/VR devices in the future, once the technology becomes more mature and affordable.

## Practicality

**Practical technology**

Mundis needs to be immediately accessible using current widespread technologies to reach a broad audience. While being less immersive than AR/VR Headsets, desktop and smartphone platforms have provided access to virtual realities for years. Their potential is proven by 3 billion currently active gamers.

**Practical purpose**

To become mainstream, the Metaverse needs to have a practical use for anyone, not just gamers, investors, and NFT artists.  
We propose a virtual collaboration and socialization platform that can equip the user with creative communication tools. The untapped potential of the Multiverse lies in its ability to enhance interpersonal communication. Users gain access to a range of powerful dramatic tools and effects, enhancing communication and expression, giving the virtual medium new meaning and an important place in our everyday lives.

**Practical UI**

To enable wide-scale usability, Mundis introduces a UI that incorporates well-established gaming features but eliminates unnecessary or outdated conventions, like forcing avatars to walk to a certain point to accomplish a task that could have been solved with a click. Besides navigation and interaction in virtual spaces, Mundis will add new features to convey better and express information that includes avatar expression effects, P2P interactions, and social collaboration, allowing users to share information and interact in many ways.

The user can customize on-screen contextual information influenced by his surroundings. He can organize, search, prioritize, and integrate other apps to share text, images, watch videos, receive social media updates, make video calls, rate experiences, and provide feedback. Mundis will have deep social media integration to integrate social media content into the experience.
