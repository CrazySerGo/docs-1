title: Shape and Structure
---

The Construct includes five main interconnected components where users can engage and perform meaningful actions:

* The Personal Space 
* The Wardrobe Mall 
* The Boulevard and side streets 
* The Workplace with its Virtual HQ and Hub

## Personal Space

It is the entry to Mundis, the start of the user journey. This fully customizable personal space will provide UI options and setups for work and a vast range of activities like social gatherings, games, concerts, etc.

The Personal Space will have the option to accommodate several live users. Their participation will not depend on a full-scale Mundis profile; any user can enter using a Guest avatar, only being required to install the app and supply a basic info set: email / username / password. Guests will have a limited UI but will fully participate in the experience. 

Users can set up their profile, add photos, videos, but also offer access to a non-live version of their **Personal Space, a 3D extension of their profile that can be navigated and experienced by other users**. Visiting users can experience media or original setups, either directly by entering the space or viewing a **Friends Tunnel**, an exploratory experience linking all friendly personal spaces into a walkable tunnel. 

## Wardrobe & the Wardrobe Mall

The Wardrobe will be used to create an "according to life" avatar, including detailed information like exact shoe size, skin tone, or hair complexion, and to create and edit your public avatar.

This avatar will not be limited to mirroring your exact form in the Metaverse and will provide many options for avatar personalization. However, to experience complete brand services - the "according to life" avatar will be mandatory to create. Still, it will be kept private at your discretion and only used for your benefit, giving you detailed and specific options on what info you share with brands about the interaction with their products.

In The Wardrobe, users can create the private "according to life" avatar with detailed information like exact shoe size, skin tone, or hair complexion, and their public avatar. 

The mall's purpose is to allow users to try out and experience virtual brand products, ease In-Real-Life acquisition, or use dedicated commercial products from any Metaverse built for Mundis, right from their Wardrobe.

Products will be experienced here directly on your avatar through skins, acquired through a skin marketplace, clothing, accessories, or other NFTs you can use in Mundis.

## The Boulevard

Social and brand experiences will happen in a specific virtual interaction space you can access from your Mundis interface (and enter through your Personal Space). The Virtual Boulevard is a social space where you can explore and interact with other users or brands, play games, live meet, socialize, share information, and rate services, products, and brands.

The graphics of the Boulevard will attempt a highly realistic mirroring of life but will feature unique architecture and structures. The Boulevard itself will be shaped like a circle, with Side Streets developing on its exterior side. Side Street content will not be visible from the Boulevard, with users having to access the street to view its contents.

A cycle of day-night will be kept on the Boulevard. On half of the Boulevard will be day and the other night. It will take 24h for a complete day-night cycle, every spot on the Boulevard benefiting from both moods.

## Workplace

We aim to offer a series of helpful presentation tools, brand manifestation spaces, and management structures that allow modern business collaboration. The Workplace is a virtual workplace for online meetings, relaying content, and presentations. It's a virtual environment accessible from your Personal Space, with unique fixed camera modes optimized for different scenarios: presentations, meetings, concerts, workshops, collaborative work, etc. 

The available camera modes help participants to focus their attention on the organizer by viewing the complete Workplace scene together with text, video screens, effects, participants, and their feedback.

Instant access to your Workplace will be provided via invitation links. Anyone can join a Workplace through the invitation link as a guest or as a Citizen. The primary purpose is to allow users to create an immersive communication and presentation experience by enhancing data visualization, staging, virtual object, and image manipulation and using compelling novel video and text integration mechanisms.

A set of avatar and interface customizations, object inventory, setups, and actions are available by default, but 3rd party developers can contribute their content as NFTs.

### The Virtual HQ

This is your new company office: a private, customizable space designed to help users inform their guests about their work or experience and showcase their venue. A unique visual manifestation space can be created with a personalized interface and action set, an adaptable display space, a programable experience tool, and a meeting space that can accommodate various setups and scenery. 

### The Hub

A new way to enhance daily work experience in your company, do employee training and development, motivate your team, or have some fun. 

The Hub is an organizational add-on to the Virtual HQ, offering multiple setups and controls. As a result, organizations can translate valuable processes in the virtual space, like brainstorming, presentations, project follow-up, and teambuilding. It will also allow the development of a healthy and engaging organizational culture using gamification elements and progressive accumulation.
