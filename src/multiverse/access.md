Gaining access to the Mundis boulevard or its side streets is a two-step process. First, the entity needs to purchase a venue that can be placed on the Boulevard. This venue is an NFT and can be:

* a bespoke building created by Mundis for special partners
* a standard building with preconfigured branding options (e.g., dedicated info spaces, logos, or other info devices)

Purchasing the venue will enable the option to bid for a specific location on the Boulevard. Mundis holds auctions for all boulevard locations on a fixed schedule (e.g., trimestral) dictated by network consensus rules. 

Boulevard auctions happen on-chain, so anyone that holds a venue NFT is free to submit their bid. Bids contain two pieces of information: the location on the Boulevard and the duration of the lease slot (e.g., max one year). Auction winners must lock up their bid in a bond for the duration of the lease slot at the beginning of the auction.
