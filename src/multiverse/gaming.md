Gaming is an integral part of the Mundis experience, and all interaction with the platform will be gamified to an extent. On-platform gamification will reward the evolution of your avatar, the types of interaction users get involved in, and the feedback you get from other users. A brand experience can also be gamified, allowing parallel quests, the gathering of experience, or other reward systems to motivate users.

An array of Play-to-earn and Create-to-earn systems and options will be provided to any user.

### User experience

Your personal evolution in the Multiverse, including changes on your avatar, editing your Personal Space, trading, using Business Mode, cruising The Boulevard, or interacting with users and Brands will be motivated by a series of quests and tasks, with prizes in crypto, useful NFTs (skins or items) or communication effects.

A user rating system will also change in value depending on your actions and the feedback you get from other users.

Mundis will offer a series of games to familiarize its users with the Multiverse, help them master new skills like trading or creating NFTs or just offer a fun experience. These games will have separate systems with their own rewards.

### Brand experience

Upon acquiring space on the Boulevard or side streets, brands will be able to offer their own play-to-earn experiences to Mundis users, offering NFTs, tokens, or other rewards	Completely separate ecosystems can be integrated into the Mundis metaverse, with their own currency and rules.

Users will be able to access them from the Boulevard or directly from the UI.
