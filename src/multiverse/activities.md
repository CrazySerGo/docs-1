Mundis will be designed to accommodate specific activities, both structurally and from a UI/UX perspective. 

## Social Interaction

Mundis is a venue for peer-to-peer information exchange, socialization, and social aggregation. Users will be able to present a personal profile and a feed, check out other profiles, interact, and form and join groups.

Friend lists, profiles, feeds, groups, and other social media tools will be accessible, offering UI integrated classic search and visualization options.

Meeting people and general interaction in Mundis will start in your Personal Space, where you can invite your friends and trade NFTs. It will continue on the Boulevard and its side streets, where you will be able to play games or enjoy other experiences by visiting side buildings.

Mundis includes engaging communication tools, character action sets, and controls to enhance socialization in all virtual spaces. This UI will focus on virtual communication, forgoing all unnecessary tropes of the gaming paradigm (e.g., the need to perform an unnecessary movement to reach a certain marker with your avatar to accomplish a certain task), and minimize efforts to allow more user expression.  

The user can customize on-screen contextual information about what he sees. He will organize, search, prioritize, and integrate apps to watch videos, receive social media updates, perform video calls, view documents, rate experiences, provide feedback, and integrate content from social media platforms.
The non-comprehensive list of interaction capabilities is designed to maximize social interaction via a set of options:

* **Communication**: live audio and video capabilities, live texting, live document sharing, and visualization
* **Expressing emotions**: avatar mood add-ons, personalized avatar unique gestures & effects
* **Rating**: an engaging service/experience rating system
* **3rd party content display**: the possibility to showcase your social media posts, stories, personal information, photos & videos. Options to showcase your game stats, game sessions, or live play

The UI will be adapted for each specific environment. For example, users have some available options on The Boulevard, while other options will be enabled or disabled in their Personal Spaces and Workplace. The set of available options for Boulevard and Personal Space interaction includes, but is not limited to:

* **Speech bubbles**: the avatar will display speech bubbles to add to an ongoing voice/video conversation.
* **Mood indicator**: a voluntary setup that you share if you are bored, happy, sad, horny, or whatever you want, and it will hover by your avatar name above your head.
* **On scene avatar entry/exit effects**: each avatar will configure his entry and exit effects, going in and out of a Personal/Meeting Space. From an elegant "teleportation" effect to less conventional "Kramer" entries, users will be able to extend their personality through various styles of effects.
* **Avatar emotion effects**: ranging through all emoticons and focusing on the most used. The users/avatars should be able to use emoticons in a variety of ways, from embodying an emoticon (displaying a smiling emoticon instead of your avatar head) to handing out a little card containing an emoticon (and other cool Emoji reveals that can add style to your feedback)
* **3D text as statements**: avatars will display text either by holding it or having it hover above their head.
* **Comparisons**: Instantly draw out temporary objects displaying animals, objects, and more from a comparison library.
* **A fun voting system**: Where users can use stars, grades, colors to:
  * vote on multiple options and add feedback to each
  * vote on a single thing and show the level you want to support it

### Boulevard Interaction

The Mundis UI will offer a set of tools to create extensive ways for avatars to interact in the virtual world. Interaction with space will also provide specific options that ease socialization, help create mood and enhance shared experiences.

Different modes for viewing your avatar on the Boulevard will be available (1st person POV, close and far 3rd person).

Avatars will be able to cruise The Boulevard and enter sidewalk apps in the form of buildings where they can solve brand or user quests for financial or experiential gains, use special places to interact in unique ways, visit business HQs, or step into dedicated brand created worlds/spaces.

The Boulevard will be available both as a walk-through experience and as an easily navigable space via the user interface. In addition, different ways to walk through the Boulevard will be made available, including **driving**, **biking**, or **flying**, each with its separate UI interface and [POV](/terminology#pov).

The walk-through experience UI can be customized to contain a detailed information feed that the user can closely adjust to his preferences. This feed will be projected over the visible field and will also influence your personal interface and options, allowing you to also visualize live feeds, videos, text, messages or to share screen. 

### Public presence

Users will be able to access the Boulevard as a shared experience and to temporarily pin their Personal Space on a designated free part of the Boulevard for 24h. After this period, the Personal Space pod will be automatically removed. The appearance of the Personal Space on the Boulevard can be made visible to anyone. This appearance will also use skins. These skins can feature messages, videos, or effects.

If no space is available for pinning, side streets can also be used for temporary pinning or the Non-Stop Personal Space pinning spaces at the end of any side street. Any number of PS can dock here with no time limit. As the side street grows and features more stores, the Non-Stop area will be pushed away to make room. These Non-Stop areas will provide ample space for communities to grow and develop; the size of these areas will also influence the value of the side-street spaces.

## Collaboration

The Mundis UI/UX is adapted for professional collaboration, events, workshops, and team communication via The Workspace, HQ, and Virtual Hub.

The Workspace can accommodate large meetings where users can invite their colleagues, fans, and friends to collaborate, present their ideas, showcase a product or service, or even hold a concert or public speech/workshop.

The Scene Editor can be easily used to construct and edit full virtual experiences for your guests or team, including timed appearances, effects, or other mechanisms.
The set of available options for Workplace interaction and presentation includes, but is not limited to:

* **Collaborative Whiteboard**: A collaborative tool that enables the participants to a meeting to add text, images or to draw on a highly visible whiteboard 
* **Dramatic stage manipulation**: Instantly change the setup/scenery to add a dramatic effect. Meet in a generic presentation room but switch to a forest setting when you talk about sustainability or the seaside when you want to sell a soft drink. Dim lights progressively, shrink or enlarge the scene, add weather effects, use light spots
* **Conceptual data models and Formulas**: Where you can quickly form floating formulas or data models and use shapes, text, images, or video instead of numbers, helpful in attempting to explain complicated concepts or models
* **Collaborative 3d object manipulation**: Complex 3D objects can be moved around or edited by all meeting participants
* **Evolving elements**: Intended as presentation props, evolving elements can be displayed near the presenter to create a more evocative mood:  an erupting volcano, a growing tree, a burning bridge, aging, a depleting glass, a fast-revolving sun on the sky, etc.
* **Unveiling**: Add various revealing effects to 3d text, images, documents, or video. Either as a typical unveiling or to suggest a Tip of the Iceberg effect, where the user starts with a small thing, but reveals its true size to the audience
* **Bots**: Bots under various forms can join your presentation, supporting your presentation flow. They can be set up before the presentation or summoned in the presentation ad-hoc. Their actions can be programmed to follow specific markers with various actions, and their movement patterns will be automated by an AI. Specific bots with special programming can also be summoned, like Einstein or Lara Croft "lookalikes."
* **Time Management (Measuring, Censoring)**: Limit meetings or personal speech time with hovering timers, personal time-bars, room shrinking effects
* **Randomizing effects**: Using different randomizing systems and effects to assign teams, giveaway assignments, or designate jobs to multiple people. Systems include a fortune wheel, a rock/paper/scissors game, a spinning bottle, etc.

### Headquarters (HQ)

The Headquarters (HQ) serves as an actual office for your organization in the Mundis Multiverse. Authorized users will be able to edit this space to fit presentations or meetings, showcase the company portfolio, and set up experiences or games for any guest to take part in.

Specific special effects or avatar actions will be available only in HQ mode. These can be custom-made or acquired by the company as NFT's from the Marketplace.

### Business Processes

Built as an internal organizational resource, the Hub supports project management and team communication with special workflow and reporting tools that incentivize collaboration and productivity.

Custom group games and activities can be set up and even personalized for each team member. These set-up-controlled experiences can serve as briefing support, onboarding guides, or fun teambuilding exercises.

Activities of team members can be incentivized and sustained by a company token, gamification quests and tasks, and various play-to-earn or work-to-earn systems.
