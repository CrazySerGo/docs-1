title: Citizens
---

Mundis users become Citizens by getting an identity in the Multiverse. Some Global services are restricted only to Citizens (i.e., LaunchPad, Location, Marketplace), but an L1 chain can also make its services available only to Citizens if the builder of the L1 chain chooses to do so.

A Citizen can have an active role in the Multiverse or a specific L1 chain. In addition, he can benefit from being involved in one or more L1 chains during specific events (e.g., an airdrop when a new L1 chain is bootstrapped).

Users will have a public identity card in Mundis that is a Master Edition NFT uniquely identified by an address. The identity card can have public and private attributes. Public attributes enhance a user's Mundis profile with the following information:

* non-unique alias (e.g., megatr0n)
* social media handles (e.g., @megatr0n for Titter, megatr0n#5431 for Discord etc.)
* a small rectangle avatar image (50x50 24bit/pixel JPEG, stored in IPFS)

Private attributes are encrypted using the wallet's private key. Their hash will be visible on the public identity card, but only the owner can decrypt them. 

Users can share the identity card with interested parties as Print NFTs. This enables the owner to keep track of all issued Prints for security purposes. Under special circumstances, a user can share private attributes with another party using a special authorization flow. A requested first signs a message requesting the user's private details. Then, the user verifies the signature and issues a special Print NFT with the private attributes re-encrypted using the requester's public key. This way, only the requester can see the private information.
