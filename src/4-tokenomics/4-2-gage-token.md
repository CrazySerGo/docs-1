title: 4.2 Engage-to-Earn Token
---
GAGE is the Mundis Engage Coin. It has infinite supply, and it powers the Engage-to-earn and the MetaFi systems.

GAGE tokens will be minted exclusively by Citizens participating in the Engage-To-Earn systems. The circulating tokens supply will be controlled by the number of tokens one can mint by participating in different events.

GAGE is a utility token with an unlimited supply. The main token utility is focused on burning GAGE tokens for Construct upgrades and facilities. This creates a demand from users, brands, and sponsors.

To provide a circulating supply, the only way to buy GAGE tokens is from the Citizens that have earned them.
