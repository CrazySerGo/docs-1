title: 4.1 Mundis Governance token
---
MUNDIS is a governance token that allows holders to participate in Blockchain or Construct Governance decisions, using 5 DAO structures. They can exercise voting rights on key elements such as Foundation grant attributions to content and game creators, feature prioritization on the platform roadmap, or others.

The Mundis Coin has a fixed supply of 1 Bn, and an initial supply of 400m, which facilitates Blockchain and Construct governance.

The biggest share of the Mundis Coin will be distributed to investors through seed, private and public rounds. Other shares of the Mundis Coin will cover marketing, development, Construct Administrative DAOs, user incentives, and the team.

Vesting period will be between 1 and 2 years.

## 4.1.3 Token Utility
**Blockchain administration**

The Layer 0 blockchain and services are governed by L0 validators using DAO structures appropriate for:
- validator rewards, inflation, deflation, voting fees, transaction fees
- L0 forks, new features, bug fixes
- vetting of new Launchpad projects and DEX tokens 

**Construct administration**
The Construct has an administration system made of 4 DAOs powered by the MUNDIS Token. These will be public interest-focused organizations, that offer services to the entire Multiverse.

Some administrative systems can be accessed from the Launchpad or the Marketplace, but their Construct HQ is in The Multiverse Hall.

The Hall, through its DAOs, will hold Boulevard auctions, facilitate project crowdfunding, curate projects, maintain the advertising system, and Multiverse Expansion program.

**DAO Participation**

Participation in a Construct Administrative DAO can only be approved by the Mundis Foundation and will require staking an amount of MUNDIS coin. Approval depends on the candidate's skill set and ability to perform within the specific administrative DAO.

**Administrative tasks**

Administrative task lists are published, along with their MUNDIS reward. Participants vote on task allocation; their vote weight depends on their staked MUNDIS.
