title: Rewards
---

1. **Participation**: This will reflect many factors: if you have joined the network,  if you have active stake, your responsiveness to issues (i.e. don’t become delinquent, or actively work to resolve the issue if you become delinquent), or if you implement patches/upgrades within a reasonable timeframe (not limited to these factors). 
   * Compensation Amount: 25,000 Mundis mainnet coins per participant

2. **Attacks/Identifying Issues**: We’ll be incentivising participants for conducting network attacks, and identifying bugs within the network. Attacks/Bugs will be separated into **two separate classes**:
   1. **Serious**: Attacks/Issues that take down the network or successfully execute an economic attack. Issues that simply manifest over time due to failure of our software - without deliberate exploitation - will be excluded.
      * Compensation Amount: 20,000 Mundis mainnet coins each
   2. **Mild**: Any other attacks/issues that are identified but don’t fall within the **Serious** category.
      * Compensation Amount: 3,000 Mundis mainnet coins each
      
   The successful tester must file a github issue, describing the attack to be eligible (amongst registration etc.) for the compensation. The attack is off-limits and not to be attempted again until it has been resolved.
