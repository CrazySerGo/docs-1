### More questions related to Prohibited Conduct:
As referenced in section “4 Prohibited Conduct” of the [Terms of Participation](terms), what would be an example of providing R&S Services from a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction of my residence? Does this mean my server has to reside in the jurisdiction of my residence?

No. Servers can be in other jurisdictions that differ from a participant’s residency. By accepting the [Terms of Participation](terms) terms, the participant has represented that they are delivering their services from the US if they reside there or from outside the US if they are not residing within the US.

## How will we know what information we can and cannot share publicly?
Mundis doesn’t intend to share any confidential information during the Rattle & Shake. However, if we do, it will be called out as such within our communications verbally, by email, etc. Unless information is specifically called out as such, the information should not be considered confidential and we welcome you to share it.

## Can I validate on a Windows computer?
No, we only support Ubuntu 20.04 for Rattle & Shake.

## Do I need any skills?
Yes. You need to be comfortable with command line interfaces and Linux administration. These skills are necessary for operating a validator node day-to-day. All validators have a responsibility to run their node in a secure manner, which requires sufficient knowledge about the operating system, the hardware, the network configuration and the relevant risks. There is no way around this!
