title: The Metaverse
---

Think of it as a virtual world. It can be a computer-generated world or an augmented reality environment. It is a place anyone can visit and interact with using a computer, smartphone, or specialized VR/AR device. However, most importantly, there won't be a single Metaverse. Instead, as with any new concept, many companies will push their version of the Metaverse with specific benefits, features, economics, graphics, collectibles, and assets. As a result, we will have many Metaverses to choose from: gaming worlds, infinite maps, workplaces, social environments, and much more.

Ideally, a Metaverse will depend on a blockchain architecture. This is only natural since a blockchain provides the means to implement monetary value in the Metaverse. A suitable blockchain would need to be flexible and fast enough to implement and execute the rules of the entire Metaverse. In addition, it would need to interact with other blockchains, so users of the Metaverse could benefit from all things already built on those chains: NFTs, games, tokens, smart-contracts, data oracles, scaling solutions, and more.

It would be an ecosystem with the proper scalability, performance, and instruments to accommodate the Metaverse. An ecosystem with its own rules, economy, assets, and interactions. An ecosystem you can navigate, explore, and visualize. An ecosystem you can be part of. 

We postulate several requirements a new ecosystem must have to accommodate a Metaverse:

* it needs to have a single timeline that serves as a reference system for all the events in the Metaverse 
* it must accommodate an infinite number of worlds with their own genesis and consensus rules, economies, and assets 
* all worlds in the Metaverse must be able to interact to exchange assets and monetary value 
* worlds will have custom rules, economics, graphics, and assets. World developers need the appropriate means and tools to create everything they can imagine 
* it must be able to exchange assets and information with existing blockchains: NFTs, dApps, and tokens 
* it must be able to exchange assets and tokens with other Metaverses 
* it must be able to interact with the external world (e.g., data oracles)
* members of the Metaverse must have an identity and means to advertise their resources (NFTs, tokens, worlds)
* it must be navigable and provide visual means to explore the Metaverse 
* it must be highly secure
