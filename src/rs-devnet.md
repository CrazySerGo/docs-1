Rattle & Shake is an ongoing series of incentivised scheduled events that will run continuously throughout the remainder of 2020, where our community can help deploy and test different blockchain releases.

Each Rattle & Shake event will generally run for a month at a time, and will focus on a specific Mundis blockchain release, starting with The Devnet, then following with the Testnet release.

The Rattle & Shake events ensure will have a process by which network vulnerabilities and adversarial strategies can be consistently tested and addressed, before being implemented into the Mainnet.

The first “Rattle & Shake the devnet” event will begin on 6th of June, validators can already register.
