The backbone of Mundis is a blockchain infrastructure. It governs all transactions that happen in the Multiverse and all its Metaverses, handles consensus between validators, and keeps a verified history of all Layer 1 worlds. The Backbone is a development platform that will evolve to be an ecosystem of interconnected worlds.

It has two major components:

* **[Layer 0](layer0.md)**: An infrastructure chain that provides a global, forward-moving clock, checkpoints L1 chains, handles positioning and global navigation, and drives governance for the Multiverse. It has a fast consensus mechanism designed for speed and sub-second finality, and native support for Multiverse services: Identity Management, Name Service, Decentralized Storage, CDN, Launchpad, Bridges, Garbage Collection, Location, etc.
* **[Layer 1](layer1.md)**: Interoperable worlds, created as specialized, byzantine state machines with PoS-based consensus. Each chain has its own genesis and consensus rules, optional smart-contract support, DAOs, and more.
