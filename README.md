# Docs Readme

Mundis Docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) with `npm`.

### Installing Docusaurus

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
(You might have to run build.sh first if you run into failures)

```sh
$ npm run start
```

### Build Locally

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static content hosting service.

```sh
$ docs/build.sh
```
